# oot-entrance-randomizer-pathfinder
A graph-based pathfinder for the Ocarina of Time Entrance Randomizer

Made over the summer of 2022, when I got really into playing Ocarina of Time Randomized.

The CLI works pretty well.  The only thing I would want to add is a way to save and load graphs (into a .json perhaps).

The GUI is very unfinished, but it does run.

I haven't touched this code in a few months, ever since school started back up, but I was surprised to find how well it worked.  Maybe I'll finish it!


**Run instructions**

Clone the repository into a folder of your choosing.

From there, assuming you have Java installed on your system, the CLI should run fine from any command line of your choosing (I normally run it from inside Visual Studio Code, using Powershell as the command line).

For the GUI, you need to have JavaFX as well.  Again, I normally run it from Visual Studio Code.
